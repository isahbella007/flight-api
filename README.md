# Description #
The Flight Information Retrieval API is a backend project that leverages a freely available flight search API, Aviation Stack API, to retrieve and deliver up-to-date flight information to users. The primary goal of the project is to create a robust and user-friendly API that allows users to search for flights based on the IATA code of an airport(departure & arrival) and receive relevant flight data in response.
